# Render Deployment Fix

## Issue

The deployment was failing on Render due to PyTorch version compatibility issues with Python 3.13.4.

## Solution

1. **Updated requirements.txt** - Changed from exact versions (`==`) to minimum versions (`>=`) for better compatibility
2. **Created runtime.txt** - Specified Python 3.11.9 for better package compatibility
3. **Created deployment-specific requirements** - `requirements-deploy.txt` with optimized dependencies
4. **Created render.yaml** - Render-specific configuration for optimal deployment
5. **Updated Dockerfile** - Changed base image from Python 3.9 to 3.11

## Key Changes

### requirements.txt

- Changed `torch==2.1.1` to `torch>=2.5.0` (compatible with Python 3.11+)
- Made all package versions flexible with `>=` instead of `==`
- Removed `sqlite3` (built-in with Python)

### New Files

- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.11.9
- `requirements-deploy.txt` - Minimal dependencies for deployment
- `requirements-minimal.txt` - Bare minimum for basic functionality
- `render.yaml` - Render service configuration

### Dockerfile

- Updated base image from `python:3.9-slim` to `python:3.11-slim`

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Use deployment-specific requirements

Update your Render build command to:

```
pip install -r requirements-deploy.txt
```

### Option 2: Use the updated requirements.txt

The main requirements.txt should now work with Python 3.11.9

### Option 3: Use render.yaml

Render will automatically detect and use the render.yaml configuration

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set these in Render:

- `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- Any other app-specific variables from your .env file

## Health Check

The app has a health endpoint at `/health` which Render can use for health checks.
